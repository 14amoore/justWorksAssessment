# Justworks Take Home Assessment
This repo was created as part of completing the Justworks take home assessment. The prompt for the assessment can be found in prompt.md.

### Instructions to run:
Simply clone this repo and run `node index.js` from the root of the project by typing it into your terminal and hitting return.


I've set the initial amount to invest at $100K. To change the amount, open index.js and enter whatever amount you would like.

### Potential next steps:
What I do not know are the investment minimums for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Because of this there are no warnings about a potential investment being too small. A way to go further would be to get information on the smallest portion of Bitcoin and Ethereum can be bought and add warnings to the code so users would know if the amount the plan to invest is too small.
